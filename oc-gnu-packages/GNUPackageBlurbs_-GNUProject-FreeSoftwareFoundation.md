## GNU Package Blurbs

The following list gives short blurbs for [official GNU packages](https://www.gnu.org/software/software.html) with links to their home pages. [More documentation of GNU packages](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html).

#### 3DLDF

GNU 3DLDF supports 3D drawing with output to the MetaPost format via a language similar to Metafont. It is primarily intended to provide a means of creating 3D content for TeX documents, but it can also create animations containing text typeset by TeX.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#pkg_3dldf))

#### 8sync

8sync (pronounced “eight-sync”) is an asynchronous programming library for GNU Guile. It makes use of delimited continuations to avoid a mess of callbacks, resulting in clean, easy-to-read, non-blocking code.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#pkg_8sync))

#### a2ps

GNU a2ps converts almost anything to a PostScript file, ready for printing. It accomplishes this by being able to delegate files to external handlers, such as Groff and Gzip. It handles as many steps as is necessary to produce a pretty-printed file. It also includes some extra abilities for special cases, such as pretty-printing `--help` output.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#a2ps))

#### Acct

GNU acct provides a means for system administrators to determine system usage patterns. It provides information on, for example, connections, programs executed, and system resources used.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#acct))

#### Acm

GNU ACM is a flight simulator in which players can compete in aerial combat from different computers, piloting well-equipped jet aircraft similar to an F-16C Falcon or a MiG-29 Fulcrum.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#acm))

#### Adns

GNU adns is a C library that provides easy-to-use DNS resolution functionality. The library is asynchronous, allowing several concurrent calls. The package also includes several command-line utilities for use in scripts.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#adns))

#### Alive

GNU Alive sends periodic pings to a server, generally to keep a connection alive.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#alive))

#### Anastasis

GNU Anastasis is a free software protocol and implementation that allows users to securely deposit core secrets with a public set of escrow providers, and allows users to recover these secrets if their original copies are lost.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#anastasis))

#### Anubis

Anubis is a daemon that sits between the Mail User Agent (MUA) and the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA). When a mail is sent by a user in the MUA, it is first passed to Anubis, which performs additional processing to the message before passing it on for delivery by the MTA. Anubis may, for example, modify the message headers or body, or encrypt or sign the message.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#anubis))

#### APL

GNU APL is a free interpreter for the programming language APL. It is an implementation of the ISO standard 13751.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#apl))

#### Archimedes

Archimedes is a free package for semiconductor device simulations. It is intended to assist engineers in designing and simulating submicron and mesoscopic semiconductor devices based on the Ensemble Monte Carlo method. It is able to handle a wide variety of materials and structures, which are described through simple scripts.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#archimedes))

#### Aris

Aris is a program for performing logical proofs. It supports propositional and predicate logic, as well as Boolean algebra and arithmetical logic. In addition to its predefined inference and equivalence rules, Aris also supports references to older proofs. Its use of standard logical symbols and its natural deduction interface make it easy to use for beginners.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#aris))

#### Artanis

GNU Artanis is a web application framework written in Guile Scheme. A web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of dynamic websites, web applications, web services and web resources. The framework aims to alleviate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. Artanis provides several tools for web development: database access, templating frameworks, session management, URL-remapping for RESTful, page caching, and more.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#artanis))

#### Aspell

Aspell is a spell-checker which can be used either as a library or as a standalone program. Notable features of Aspell include its full support of documents written in the UTF-8 encoding and its ability to use multiple dictionaries, including personal ones.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#aspell))

#### AUCTeX

AUCTeX is an integrated environment for producing TeX documents in Emacs. It allows many different standard TeX macros to be inserted with simple keystrokes or menu selection. It offers an interface to external programs, enabling you to compile or view your documents from within Emacs. AUCTeX also features the ability to place inline previews of complex TeX statements such as mathematical formulae.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#auctex))

#### Autoconf

Autoconf offers the developer a robust set of M4 macros which expand into shell code to test the features of Unix-like systems and to adapt automatically their software package to these systems. The resulting shell scripts are self-contained and portable, freeing the user from needing to know anything about Autoconf or M4.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#autoconf))

#### Autoconf-archive

Autoconf Archive is a collection of over 450 new macros for Autoconf, greatly expanding the domain of its functionality. These macros have been contributed as free software by the community.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#autoconf-archive))

#### AutoGen

AutoGen is a program to ease the maintenance of programs that contain large amounts of repetitive text. It automates the construction of these sections of the code, simplifying the task of keeping the text in sync. It also includes an add-on package called AutoOpts, which is specialized for the maintenance and documentation of program options.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#autogen))

#### Automake

Automake the part of the GNU build system for producing standards-compliant Makefiles. Build requirements are entered in an intuitive format and then Automake works with Autoconf to produce a robust Makefile, simplifying the entire process for the developer.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#automake))

#### Avl

libavl provides a large collection of binary search tree and balanced tree routines for C. These trees offer at least O(log n) performance for usually costly operations such as searching, inserting or deleting items from a data structure.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#avl))

#### Ball and Paddle

Ball and Paddle is a classic arcade game in which you use a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball against bricks in the upper region, eliminating the bricks as they are hit. As a novel twist, events and attributes of all the objects (bricks, ball, etc.) may be scripted with GNU Guile.([doc](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html#ballandpaddle))

#### Barcode
