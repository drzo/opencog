A *microkernel* is one kind of a [kernel](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/kernel.html) implementation.

[Liedtke](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/liedtke.html) explains in [On Microkernel Construction](http://l4ka.org/publications/paper.php?docid=642) (or from [TU Dresden](http://www.tud-os.org/papers_ps/jochen/Mikern.ps), or from [ACM](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=224075)) that a microkernel attempts to minimize the mandatory part of the operating system by providing the minimal number of [mechanism](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/mechanism.html) s that maximize the flexibility of implementation (by imposing minimal [policy](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/policy.html)) while allowing the efficient implementation of the remainder of the system.

The idea of a microkernel as explained above was first explored by Per Brinch-Hansen in 1970 in [The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System](http://brinch-hansen.net/papers/1970a.pdf).

An [introduction](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/ulfar/ukernel/ukernel.html) by Ãšlfar Erlingsson and Athanasios Kyparlis (from 1996) to microkernel concepts.
