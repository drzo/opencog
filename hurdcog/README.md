# HurdCog: The Cognitive Operating System 🧠

**OpenCog IS the Agent Kernel that GNU Hurd has been searching for!**

Not OpenCog running on Hurd, but **Hurd transformed into its true cognitive form**.

## 🎯 Core Insight

GNU Hurd's problems (grip, identity, coherence, trust, resources) are **exactly** what cognitive architectures solve. OpenCog provides:

- **Universal Grip** via AtomSpace
- **Persistent Identity** via hypergraph signatures  
- **Coherence** via PLN reasoning
- **Trust** via capability atoms
- **Resources** via ECAN attention

## 🚀 Quick Start

```scheme
;; Load the HurdCog demo
(load "hurdcog/demo/hurdcog-demo.scm")

;; Create a cognitive file
(define my-file (create-cognitive-file "test.txt"))

;; Write with coherence checking
(cognitive-write my-file "Hello, Cognitive OS!")

;; Read with attention tracking
(cognitive-read my-file)
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### MachSpace (AtomSpace as Microkernel)
```scheme
;; Every system object is an atom
(define port (create-mach-port 1001 '("read" "write")))
```

### Cognitive Grip (Universal Object Handling)
```scheme
;; Five-finger grip on any object
(define grip (grip-object "system-resource"))
```

### Cognitive Translators (Thinking Services)
```scheme
;; Translators that learn and evolve
(define fs (make-cognitive-translator "cognitive-fs"))
```

## 📊 Component Mapping

| GNU Hurd | → | HurdCog |
|----------|---|----------|
| Mach Ports | → | MachPort Atoms |
| Translators | → | Cognitive Agents |
| Memory Pages | → | Hypergraph Nodes |
| Capabilities | → | Capability Atoms |
| Scheduler | → | ECAN Attention |
| RPC | → | Cognitive Messages |

## 🔧 Implementation Status

✅ **Completed:**
- MachSpace core (ports as atoms)
- Cognitive Grip mechanism
- Basic cognitive translator
- Demo showing core concepts

🔄 **In Progress:**
- Hypergraph memory management
- ECAN scheduler integration
- PLN coherence validation
- MOSES system evolution

📝 **TODO:**
- Integration with actual Mach microkernel
- Guix package definitions
- Distributed AtomSpace sharding
- Full translator ecosystem

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept ✅
Demonstrate core concepts with pure Scheme/OpenCog implementation.

### Phase 2: Mach Integration
1. Create FFI bindings to Mach primitives
2. Replace libports with MachSpace
3. Implement cognitive message passing

### Phase 3: Translator Migration
1. Start with simple translators (null, hello)
2. Progress to filesystem translators
3. Eventually replace all translators

### Phase 4: Full System
1. Boot actual Hurd with cognitive kernel
2. Distributed AtomSpace across machines
3. System-wide MOSES evolution

## 🤝 Why This Works

The "grip problem" that has plagued GNU Hurd for decades is fundamentally a **cognitive problem**. Objects need:

1. **Universal representation** (AtomSpace)
2. **Persistent identity** (hypergraph signatures)
3. **Coherent state** (PLN validation)
4. **Trust boundaries** (capability atoms)
5. **Resource management** (ECAN attention)

OpenCog provides ALL of these out of the box!

## 🌐 Vision

An OS where:
- Every operation **thinks**
- Configuration **evolves** 
- Problems **solve themselves**
- Identity **persists** through all transformations
- Resources flow by **attention**

**HurdCog: Where Man and Machine shake hands through the same cognitive architecture!**
