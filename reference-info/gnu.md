## The GNU Operating System

The GNU Operating System, or GNU System as it is more commonly known, will be a complete [Unix](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/unix.html) -like operating system composed entirely of [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). The creation of the GNU System is one of the goals of the [GNU Project](http://www.gnu.org/), which was [launched in 1983](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html) by [Richard Stallman](http://www.stallman.org/).
