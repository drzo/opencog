## On Posting

Before asking a question, first make an effort to find the answer to your question. A lot of questions have been asked and answered before, so please spend some time trying to solve the problem on your own (e.g., [search the web](http://google.com/), search these web pages, etc.), and show us that you did so when you ask your question.

When asking, (1) be details, and (2) demonstrate that you have made an effort, e.g., "I am having trouble frobbing the foo. I searched the web and only found information regarding how to frob a bar, but that seems unrelated." Provide as many relevant details as possible reproducing them as exactly as possible.

This [document](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) may help you understand some developers attitudes and social norms.

List etiquette is to cc the sender and anyone **actively** involved in the discussion. Some people don't like this and they set their reply-to header appropriately. Respect this.

It is rarely appropriate to cc multiple lists. Sometimes it is. In that case, do so. If in doubt, don't; just choose the single most appropriate list.

When replying to others, please don't top-post and trim the existing text to quote only the sections you're actually replying to. See [Posting style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting%5Fstyle) for further reading, especially [Posting style#Interleaved style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting%5Fstyle%23Interleaved%5Fstyle).

Also see these general notes about [communication](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/community/communication.html).

## Spam

GNU mailing lists used to have no spam filtering applied -- everyone was allowed to post, the lists were completely unmoderated. This resulted in getting the lists spammed very much, as you can see in the web archives. If you're interested in getting hold of (mostly) spam-free mboxes, then talk to [Thomas Schwinge](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/user/tschwinge.html). Also [read about](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/mailing_lists/unmoderated.html) the spam-rejection techniques being used today.
