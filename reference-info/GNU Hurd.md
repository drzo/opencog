**What is the GNU Hurd?**

The GNU Hurd is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel. It is a collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel to implement file systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features that are implemented by the Unix kernel or similar kernels (such as Linux).*[More detailed](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/documentation.html).*

**What is the mission of the GNU Hurd project?**

Our mission is to create a general-purpose kernel suitable for the GNU operating system, which is viable for everyday use, and gives users and programs as much control over their computing environment as possible.*[Our mission explained](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/community/weblogs/antrik/hurd-mission-statement.html).*

Download latest stable release [here](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hurd/hurd-0.9.tar.gz) or [browse the Git repository](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd).

## Contributing

So, you are interested in contributing to the GNU Hurd project? Welcome! Every single contribution is very much encouraged. Please read our [detailed recommendations about how to contribute](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/contributing.html).

See our [source repositories](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/source_repositories.html) for the source code.

## Access to a GNU/Hurd System

We provide accounts on our [public Hurd boxen](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/public_hurd_boxen.html), and there are also several GNU/Hurd [Distributions](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/distrib.html) that allow for [QEMU](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/qemu.html) emulation.

## Getting Help

There are a couple of different [FAQ lists](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.html). There are a number of [IRC channels](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/irc.html) and several different [mailing lists](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/mailing_lists.html) with searchable archives.

Before asking a question on a mailing list or on IRC, first, please try to answer your own question using a search engine and reading the introductory information. If you have done this and you cannot find the answer to your question, feel free to ask on a mailing list or on IRC.

## Running the Hurd

The most functional distribution of the Hurd is the one provided by Debian. Find more information about it at the [Debian GNU/Hurd website](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install).

Along with it there are [various ways](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running.html) to run a GNU/Hurd system. Three of them are

- Installing a [GNU/Hurd distribution](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/distrib.html),
- Running it [in Xen](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/mach/gnumach/ports/xen.html) and
- Starting a Hurd [QEMU image](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/qemu.html) or [LiveCD](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/live_cd.html).

And these web pages are a living proof of the usability of the Hurd, as they are rendered on a [Debian GNU/Hurd](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/debian.html) system.

## Current Status

The latest GNU releases are **Hurd 0.9**, **Mach 1.8**, and **MIG 1.8** [(Release Notes)](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/news/2016-12-18-releases.html), 2016-12-18.

The Hurd is developed by [a few volunteers in their spare time](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq/how_many_developers.html). The project welcomes any assistance [you can provide](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/contributing.html). Porting and development expertise is still badly needed in many key areas.

Functional systems are installable in a dual-boot configuration. Development systems are currently mostly based on the [Debian GNU/Hurd](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/debian.html) port sponsored by the [Debian project](http://www.debian.org/).

Aside from this Wiki, community resources for related projects focus around *[gnu.org](https://hurd.gnu.org/)*, the *[mailing lists](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/mailing_lists.html)*, and the *[IRC channels](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/irc.html)*.

If you want to see the current discussions in the Hurd project, please have a look at the [bug-hurd mailinglist archives](http://lists.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/). If you want to have a look at the current coding work, you can just head over to our [source repositories](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/source_repositories.html).

For more details, please read our writeup on the [current state of the GNU Hurd](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/status.html).

## Advantages and Challenges

The GNU Hurd operating system design provides [advantages](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/advantages.html), but uncovers new [challenges](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/challenges.html), too.
