GNU MIG is the GNU distribution of the [Mach 3.0 interface generator *MIG*](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/mach/mig.html), as maintained by the GNU Hurd developers for the GNU project.

You need this tool to compile the GNU Mach and GNU Hurd distributions, and to compile the GNU C library for the Hurd. Also, you will need it for other software in the GNU system that uses Mach-based [inter-process communication](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/mach/ipc.html).

GNU MIG is fully compatible with [OSF MIG](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/mach/mig.html).

Like its predecessor, it can only generate C code, that has to be compiled and linked to client and server programs respectively ().

The latest release is [GNU MIG 1.8](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/news/2016-12-18-releases.html).
