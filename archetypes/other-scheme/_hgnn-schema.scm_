;; ================================================================
;; THE ABOVE FLOW IS A RECURSIVE IMPLEMENTATION PATHWAY
;; OF THE HGNN DATABASE:
;; 1. INPUT NODES ARE EMBEDDED VIA THE NODE-EMBEDDING LAYER.
;; 2. MESSAGE PASSING UPDATES THE REPRESENTATION WITH EDGE INFORMATION.
;; 3. READOUT LAYER GENERATES TASK-SPECIFIC PREDICTIONS.
;; 4. SUPPLY CHAIN QUERIES AND CROSS-TENANT FILTERS ENABLE
;;    DYNAMIC AND ADAPTIVE DATA INSIGHTS.
;;
;; This structured hypergraph model encapsulates distributed cognition:
;; each node and edge contributes to the emergent neural-symbolic integration,
;; facilitating advanced analytics and recommendations for a vibrant beauty marketplace.
